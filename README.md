Internet of Things, by Alistair

Invigorated by 'work' in WiFi WS2812 repo I decided its time to make the "proper" version. Extensible, proper ui, modularity, y'know - all those good things we want in modern software. Then I needed to make something similar for an embedded device (ESP8266). Docs and explanations will be coming as I finish more, this is by and large a learning experience.

Currently working functions
+ internal diagnostics about esp8266
+ serial -> teensy 3.2 -> ws2812b led display
+ network ping
