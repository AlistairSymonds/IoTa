Internet of Things, by Alistair

Invigorated by 'work' in WiFi WS2812 repo I decided its time to make the "proper" version. Extensible, proper ui, modularity, y'know - all those good things we want in modern software. Then I needed to make something similar for an embedded device (ESP8266). Currently the framework is in a very beta state but it does work for simple tasks. (Ping the esp) Docs and explanatiosn will be coming as I finish more, this is by and large a learning experience.
